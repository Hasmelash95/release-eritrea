[Check out the deployed site](https://release-eritrea.herokuapp.com/)

Proclaim! Release Eritrea is a human rights charity advocating for the persecuted Christians in Eritrea. It is a global partnership which advocates on behalf of victims of abuse by the PDFJ's (the ruling party of Eritrea) regime and provides humanitarian assistance to the victims and their families. The website offers updates to those who wish to learn more about the human rights abuses happening in Eritrea with press releases that logged in users can comment on and bookmark in their favorites. In addition, there are social media links and profiles of the members of Release Eritrea in case those visiting the site wish to get in touch and get involved.

## User Experience (UX) <a name="user-experience">

### Strategy 
  
#### User Stories
  
The website is targeted toward any who are interested in aiding humanitarian efforts and wish to support Eritrean Christians who are being persecuted as well as any who know nothing about the charity and wish to learn more. It provides information via Press Releases and introduction texts for those unaware of the situation in Eritrea. 
  
Using Agile Methodology, User Stories were created from Themes and Epics with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hasmelash95/release-eritrea/issues). Each User Story was marked with a label for prioritisation. Must do, Should do, Could do, Won't do. The latter are to be implemented in the next iteration (see future features). They were compiled as a result of lengthy discussion with the Director of Release Eritrea and potential users to establish what the target audience would be looking for in a site.

### Scope
  
The website will contain user authentication to allow those with staff permissions to log in and access the admin database and those with user permissions to comment and favorite posts. 
  
A single page will contain the About Us section (which will contain external links to partner charities and another page with information on the Team and Release Eritrea offices). The main page will provide a list of Press Releases which can be navigated through using pagination. Clicking on any one of these will take the user to the article detail page where they can comment - which will be processed for admin approval - and favorite the article. The home page will also contain a gallery section which can be edited by admin. 
  
There will be links to allow users to access their favorites page and the search filter page to filter articles by tags and title content. 
  
Those with admin permissions will be able to add, edit and delete articles from the front end. 
  
Social media links will be available on the footer along with the charity and company number. 

### Structure

The logo at the header contains a link to the home page. Navigation links on the header allow users to navigate to the Home and the three sections on the home page, About Us, Press Releases, Gallery. Another link takes the user to the info page. User authentication links are also present on the header to take users to the log in, sign up or logout pages. 
  
The Press Releases section shows 6 article previews a page and clicking on any of the previews takes the user to that specific article. Attempting to access an article that has been deleted will raise a 404 error and the users will be taken to a custom 404 error page.

The Picture, Location and Profile Models (Profile of Members of Release Eritrea rather than User Profile) do not have relationships with other entities. 
  
The Article ID has One-to-Many relationship with the Comment Model. The User Model has a One-to-Many relationship with the Article ID, a One-to-Many relationship with the Comment Model and a Many-to-Many relationship with the favorities attribute within the Article Model.

### Surface 

Noto Serif Oriya and Roboto fonts were imported from google fonts for the headers and main text respectively. The main colour themes for the site use bootstrap backgrounds. text-bg-primary and text-bg-light classes ensure the foreground and background colours do not clash with bg-gradient also used for a gradient effect for the backgrounds. The main text within the site is rgb(0, 95, 161), a colour close to black. 

Other bootstrap classes are used to colour in the buttons, to ensure that they stood out in the page and are still visible against the background. Font awesome icons decorate some of the headings and the buttons to add a touch of decor to the site. 
  
A fade in effect is triggered when an object is visible to the user - some elements begin to appear as the user scrolls. 
  
## Features
  
### Header and Hero
  
The header contains the logo of Release Eritrea along with the name (a bird breaking a chain) along with the nav elements which take the users to specific sections of the page or to other sites within the page. There are Sign In and Sign Up options for users who have not been authenticated with links to the relevant pages. 
  
![Screenshot 2023-01-22 at 14 28 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/213921167-873ee366-67f7-4498-a03d-e4bb03482ec1.png)

If the User has already signed in, a 'Hello, [User Name]!' appears along with a Logout link. 
  
![Screenshot 2023-01-22 at 14 28 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/213921226-074f7aa3-b7c7-410c-aa6a-1109a21707a9.png)

The Navbar remains on screen as the user scrolls to allow for easy navigation. The active page is underlined (in this case, the home page). 
  
The hero image of a hand holding chains is adjacent to a verse (recommended by the client). This fades into view when the page has loaded.

### About Us

The About Us section introduces visitors of the site to Release Eritrea and provides them information (simplified) to introduce them to the charity and what they do.

In addition, links are provided to give users additional resources, such as links to the Team Page and external links to partner charity websites (which open in another tab).

### Press Releases
  
The main draw of the site is of course the press releases. Previews with links to the detailed pages of the articles allow users to peruse through the many pages and click on whichever article captures their attention. 
  
![Screenshot 2023-01-25 at 06 45 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/214497993-57f38143-0bb3-48dc-9d4e-1b0165aa4db8.png)
  
Article detail pages have a comment section with a comment form, the latter of which is only visible to logged in users. Comments must be approved by the admin to be visible under the article.

### Browser Compatibility 
  
Website was tested on Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, iOS and Android devices and was compatible with all of them. 
  
### Testing User Stories
  
User Stories were tested for whether they fulfilled the acceptance criteria defined within [Issues](https://github.com/Hasmelash95/release-eritrea/issues). They fulfilled the criteria. 
  
The only exception are those User Stories that were labelled "won't do" as they'll be added in the next iteration.

## Bugs and Fixes
  
  ### Fixed Bugs
  1. Edit article did not keep the input fields filled in, leading users to an empty form. This was fixed by adding the 'article': article to the context.
  2. Post article did not keep the input fields when the user's form was invalid triggering a refresh of the page. This was fixed by adding article_form = ArticleForm() at the top of the function. 
  3. The spinner showed up when the user clicked the sign in/sign up buttons even if the input was empty. If statements were added to ensure the spinner showed up when the required fields were filled in. 
  4. Summernote was creating validation errors due to attributes used in the widget. This was resolved by copying the iframe file (found in the summernote div github) into a template in my directory and manually removing the attributes. 
  
  ### Unfixed Bugs
  1. There are no unfixed bugs remaining, besides the validation error triggered in the form pages due to the presence of an django widget that could not be adjusted.

## Deployment

### Deploying the App
1. Create a Heroku account or log in if you have one.
2. Click on the "Create new app" button on the dashboard.
3. Give the app a unique name. 
4. Select your region.
5. On the resources tab, select the 'Heroku Postgres' add on.
6. Click on the settings tab.
7. Add a Config Var with the key PORT and the value 8000.
8. Add CLOUDINARY_URL and SECRET_KEY to the Config Vars and an env.py file (which will be placed in gitignore). The DATABASE_URL will be generated by Heroku and can be added to the env.py file as well. 
9. Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to 1 but remove this when deploying the app. 
10. Use pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt to update the project with installed apps. 
11. Click on the deploy tab.
12. Connect to Github under deployment method, search the repository you wish to link to and click 'connect'.
13. Select either automatic or manual deploy. The former rebuilds the app everytime you git push.
14. You will see an "App was successfully deployed" message.
15. The application can be run by clicking 'Open App'.

### Cloning the Repository 
  
1. Log on to your Github account and head to the main page of the repository you wish to clone.
2. Click on the 'Code' button above the list of files and choose from HTTPS, SSH or Github CLI, to copy the URL provided.
3. Open terminal and ensure you are in the correct location.
4. Type in 'git clone' and paste the URL you'd copied in step 2 and press enter.
  
## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my mentor Brian Macharia for his help during the project. I am more than grateful for his advice and guidance and he has truly helped me feel more confident in my code. 
  
A huge thanks to the tutor team at Code Institute for helping with difficulties during the automatic testing process. I'd also like to thank Code Insistute for their resources which taught me how to use the Django framework - such as Hello Django and I Think I Blog walkthroughs. The latter of which was helpful in building my Article and Comment models.
  
I'd like to thank Release Eritrea for the resources they'd given, such as images and articles to use for the website.
